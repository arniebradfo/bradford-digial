# Hello!

I’m a curious, creative designer with a passion for both UX design and UI development, 
bridging the gap between creative ideas and the code that drives them. 
I have a solid 7 years of experience crafting engaging, user-centered design solutions in 
robotics, e-commerce, marketing, toy design, and more. 
I believe in simplicity, in minimalism, that form follows function, 
and that good design is 99% invisible.

I love this new digital world we find ourselves in, 
and I’m constantly amazed at the seemingly limitless opportunities it provides us. 
I pursue a UX career because I want to be a part of this wave of progress and innovation, 
creating tools that empower ordinary people to do extraordinary things.

Thanks for visiting my site. I hope you like it.
