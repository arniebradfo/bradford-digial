## Use Case

This app was designed to enable one user to monitor and manage several autonomous cleaning vehicles simultaneously. The app displays the status and progress of any vehicle and notifies the user in case intervention is necessary. A reporting feature displays data on vehicle utilization and runtime so users can fine tune their operations to be as efficient as possible.

## Responsive Design

The app was designed to alternate between a mobile single-column width as well as a tablet(or larger) two-column width.

### Mobile Width: Single-Column
