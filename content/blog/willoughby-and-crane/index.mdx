## Sketches

The client requested a logo of an origami crane for a consulting firm. I folded a paper model and did some sketches paired with type.

## Digital Roughs

The client liked the direction so I made some digital roughs of all 3 compositions.

## Final Logo

We decided on a simple, elegant design paired with Caslon text. The old-style, small caps typeface communicates authority and trustworthiness.
