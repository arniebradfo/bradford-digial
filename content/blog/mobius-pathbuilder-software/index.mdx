<MdxGatsbyImage fluidName={'Mobius_Pathbuilder-Steps-01.png'} />

Create a drivable path that can be customized to match testing needs and course routes.

## 02: Scriptable Action Planning

<MdxGatsbyImage fluidName={'Mobius_Pathbuilder-Steps-02.png'} />

Execute actions at a specific point in a path. Functions include: acceleration, deceleration, stop, wait, lane change, variable force braking, roll over, and more.

## 03: Vehicle Testing

<MdxGatsbyImage fluidName={'Mobius_Pathbuilder-Steps-03.png'} />

Vehicles can be tasked to run routes as many times as needed. No need to switch drivers out due to hazardous road conditions, fatigue, and driver breaks.

## Vehicle Kit

<MdxGatsbyImage fluidName={'Mobius_Pathbuilder-Ford-Fusion-with-kit.png'} />

Each unmanned test vehicle is equipped with a series of hardware and software components that permit a user to toggle between manual and robotic control. Once installed, a remote operator has control over the critical vehicle functions of ignition, transmission, steering, braking, and acceleration. The kit consists of a set sensors (GPS, radar, lidar, cameras, radio) and actuators (throttle, brake, steering, transmission) that are all controlled by an onboard computer called the Vehicle Control Unit (VCU).
